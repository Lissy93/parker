# Parker

This project (attempts to) use AI and Natural Language Processing to read and understand privacy polices, extracting and categorizing the key points.

## Motivation
We all use the internet, and so agree to privacy policies almost dailey 
for companies to collect, use and sometimes sell our personal data. 
We wanted to make it clearer for people, so designed Parker.

We use AI to understand and then clearly summerize these policies for you- 
because you shouldn't need a degree to know what your signing up to!

## Architecture

The backend is based on Azure Cloud Functions and with NLP to process the documents.
The Frontend is just simple a Vue app,  (Babel, Webpack, Core-js and Sass with eslint and prettier).

## About
Developed at HackJunction, Helsinki- by Alicie, Ollie and George.
After a few setbacks, we were a little short on time, so although the app works, it's not nearly as good as we'd hoped, and so I wouldn'd advise you use any of this code.
